Execution instructions for running the project from the command line:

Open the Flutter console (installed with Flutter) and go to the file location with command "cd" and the location. For example 

cd path/to/flutter/app

then write the following command:

flutter run

Once the app starts, you will see message in your terminal that looks like the following:

An Observatory debugger and profiler on iPhone X is available
at: http://127.0.0.1:50976/Swm0bjIe0ks=/

Once itâ€™s set up, using DevTools is as simple as opening a Chrome browser window and navigating to http://localhost:9100.

Paste the URL you got from running your app (in this example, http://127.0.0.1:50976/Swm0bjIe0ks=/) into the connect dialog to connect your app to DevTools.
